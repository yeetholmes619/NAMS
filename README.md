- Project Name : NAMS : Not another Management System | An automated Normalization tool
- Group memebers : Anirudh Srikanth (B20CS006) , Samkit Shah (B20CS059) , Vikash Yadav (B20AI061)
Note : To run the program you need C++20 and STL supported.

The code is an implementation of the following paper: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4349094_Automatic_database_normalization_and_primary_key_generation#:~:text=Normalization%20is%20the%20most%20exercised,anomalies%20due%20to%20future%20updates](Research Paper.)

The program takes the dependencies of the current database, and the functions Norm2NF, Norm3NF etc,
which returns a list of Tables after the decomposition to the respective normalisations.
